# WP-2

# main.js
check birthdate button:
It cannot determine whether your year of birth is between 1310 and 1390 or not.

error messages:
All error messages are displayed in the first paragraph at the top of the screen and not displayed separately below each box.

TODO: better way to show error messages:
Each error message should be displayed as a span under each box and each box has a span in the index.html.

# main.css
font-url:

Font URL navigation on my laptop is correct, but may be css urls incorrect in form validation folder and may not work on the form.
